To do an essay, it's very simple:

-Read and analyze the subject
-Find the problem
-Plan the essay
-Write the introduction
-Write the development
-Make the conclusion

1. Read and analyze the subject

You will have to produce an organized reflection on a specific subject that is imposed on you.

The subject can be:

-a question
-a theme or concept
-a quote

If you have multiple topics to choose from, select the one that inspires you the most and that you have the most knowledge about. You will need to choose it quickly if you have to do an essay during an exam lasting a few hours (within the first 10 minutes).

2. Find the problem
Read several times the reformulation of the subject drawn up from your definitions. In draft, write down any ideas that come to mind on the subject (examples, authors, events, ...).

3. Plan the essay
An essay outline can take many forms. The important thing is that it responds well to your problem so that you avoid going off topic.

Use your original draft where you wrote down your ideas.
Then organize these ideas by theme or argument.
Normally you will be able to come up with two or three main ideas, divided into two or three sub-parts which will be illustrated with concrete examples.
Remember to write a transition between each major part (conclusion of the current part and introduction of the next part).

4. Write the introduction
The introduction of a dissertation must follow a strict structure. It introduces the subject, the problem and the plan.

The parts of an essay introduction are:

-A leader or catchphrase.
-The subject statement.
-Definition of terms and reformulation of the subject.
-The problem.
-The announcement of the plan.

5. Write the essay development
There are always two or three parts to developing an essay. If you are doing a two part essay, you will need to write three subsections for each (two if you are doing three large parts).

Each part supports a central idea that addresses the issue, while each sub-part revolves around an argument that supports and illustrates the central idea.

Your arguments must absolutely be illustrated by an example!

Between each part, you must write a transition that concludes the previous part and announces the next part.

6. Write the conclusion
The conclusion of an essay is a brief summary of development, clearly indicating the answer to the question posed in the introduction. It is also possible to add an opening at the end.
